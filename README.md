I. From Tier 1 (Vowel Tier):
1. Dynamic vowel formant values (F1, F2, F3) at multiple time points (0%â€“10%).
2. Duration and label of the vowel.
3. Mean F1, F2, and F3 across the vowel duration.
4. Mean fundamental frequency (f0).
5. Mean intensity (I).

II. From Tiers 2 and 3 (Syllable and Word Tiers):
1. Duration and label of the corresponding syllable.
2. Duration and label of the corresponding word.
